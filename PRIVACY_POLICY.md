## GParticles: Privacy policy

Thank you for using GParticles, an open-source art project app thingy for
Android!

This app is developed by Roni Tuohino. The source code is available on GitHub
under the MIT license. The app itself is available in Google Play.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not
programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information.

The app sends analytics data for Unity regularly to: https://config.uca.cloud.unity3d.com & https://cdp.cloud.unity3d.com.

This analytics data contains fields such as
"common", with fields
"appid", "userid", "sessionid", "platform", "platformid", "sdk_ver", 
"runMode", "sdk_rev", "session_count", "localprojectid", "build_guid", 
"deviceid", "identity_token", "t_since_start"

"type" with values such as
"analytics.appResume.v1", "analytics.appRunning.v1", "analytics.appPause.v1"

"msg" with fields such as
"ts", "t_since_start", "duration", "local_time_offset", "previous_sessionid", "unity_ver"

This data cannot be erased from within the app.

To erase all local data (the program code
& cache) associated with the app, simply uninstall it.

If you find any security vulnerabilities which may have been inadvertently
caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy,
please send me an email, and I will try my best to help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Roni Tuohino
